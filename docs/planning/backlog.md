**Status**: Backlog | **Target**: Sprint 10+ | **Points**: 55

### Epic Description
Foundation and hooks for future features: gamification, kid mode, EF tagging, and AI-powered insights.

### Child Issues

#### I-029: Implement Gamification Foundation
**Priority**: Low | **Size**: L | **Points**: 13  
**Labels**: `type:feature`, `area:gamification`, `size:L`

**Problem Statement**: ADHD users benefit from motivation through points, streaks, and achievement recognition.

**Scope**:
- Points system for task completion
- Streak tracking (daily, weekly, category-specific)
- Achievement/badge framework
- Reward redemption system (placeholder)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Given** gamification is enabled
- **When** users complete tasks
- **Then** points are awarded appropriately
- **And** streaks are tracked and celebrated
- **And** achievements unlock based on behavior
- **And** reward system provides motivation

**Dependencies**: E-03 (task system)

**DoD Checklist**:
- [ ] Points calculation system
- [ ] Streak tracking implementation
- [ ] Achievement framework
- [ ] Reward redemption placeholder
- [ ] Gamification toggle
- [ ] Celebration animations

#### I-030: Create Kid Mode UI Foundation
**Priority**: Low | **Size**: L | **Points**: 13  
**Labels**: `type:feature`, `area:ui`, `size:L`

**Problem Statement**: Children with ADHD need simplified, age-appropriate interfaces with visual timers and rewards.

**Scope**:
- Simplified navigation for children
- Visual timer components
- Avatar/character system foundation
- Parent monitoring view hooks

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Given** child user logs in
- **When** kid mode is enabled
- **Then** interface is simplified and age-appropriate
- **And** visual timers help with time awareness
- **And** avatar system provides engagement
- **And** parents can monitor progress

**Dependencies**: E-02 (role system), I-029

**DoD Checklist**:
- [ ] Simplified child navigation
- [ ] Visual timer components
- [ ] Avatar system foundation
- [ ] Parent monitoring hooks
- [ ] Kid-safe content filtering
- [ ] Accessibility for children

#### I-031: Implement Executive Function Tagging
**Priority**: Low | **Size**: L | **Points**: 13  
**Labels**: `type:feature`, `area:analytics`, `size:L`

**Problem Statement**: ADHD users and clinicians benefit from understanding which executive function skills are being practiced.

**Scope**:
- EF tag assignment to tasks (Working Memory, Planning, etc.)
- EF skill progress tracking
- Insight dashboard for skill development
- Export capability for clinical use

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Given** tasks are tagged with EF skills
- **When** users complete tagged tasks
- **Then** EF skill progress is tracked
- **And** insights show skill development patterns
- **And** data can be exported for clinical review
- **And** recommendations suggest skill-building activities

**Dependencies**: E-03 (task system)

**DoD Checklist**:
- [ ] EF tagging system
- [ ] Progress tracking algorithm
- [ ] Insight dashboard foundation
- [ ] Clinical export format
- [ ] Skill recommendation engine
- [ ] EF education resources

#### I-032: Add AI Predictive Nudges Foundation
**Priority**: Low | **Size**: XL | **Points**: 16  
**Labels**: `type:feature`, `area:ai`, `size:XL`

**Problem Statement**: ADHD users benefit from predictive assistance that identifies patterns and suggests interventions.

**Scope**:
- Pattern recognition for task completion
- Risk prediction for overdue tasks
- Adaptive reminder timing
- Smart time blocking suggestions

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Given** user has historical task data
- **When** AI analyzes patterns
- **Then** predictions identify risk scenarios
- **And** adaptive reminders improve completion rates
- **And** time blocking suggestions optimize schedules
- **And** interventions feel helpful, not intrusive

**Dependencies**: E-03 (task system), E-04 (reminders)

**DoD Checklist**:
- [ ] Pattern recognition algorithm
- [ ] Risk prediction model
- [ ] Adaptive reminder engine
- [ ] Time blocking suggestions
- [ ] AI insight dashboard
- [ ] Privacy-compliant ML pipeline
